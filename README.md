# TileSearch-Artificial-Intelligence
Implementation:

My program solves the 8-puzzle and the 15-puzzle. 
❖ I have implemented:
1) A* algorithm and 
2) IDA* (another memory bounded informed search algorithm)

❖ I have implemented the graph-search version of A*. The memory-bounded algorithms make choices on how much memory to use and what to keep in memory for graph-search.
❖ I have also implemented two different admissible (or consistent) heuristic functions (h1 and h2). One dominates the other: a heuristic h1 dominates h2 if h1
(n) > h2
(n) for all n.
